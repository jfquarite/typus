Typus User Guide
================

**Typus** is a control panel for `Rails`_ applications to allow
trusted users edit structured content.

Itâ€™s not a CMS with a full working system but it provides a part of the system:
authentication, permissions and basic look and feel for your websites control
panel. So using `Rails`_ with **Typus** lets you concentrate on your
application instead of the bits to manage the system.

**Typus** is the "old latin" word for **type** which stands for:

    A category of people or things having common characteristics.

Key Features:

* Integrated authentication with Access Control Lists.
* CRUD and custom actions for your models on a clean interface.
* Internationalized interface.
* Overridable and extensible templates.
* Low memory footprint.
* Tested with **SQLite3**, **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.
* **MIT License**, the same as `Rails`_.

You can directly participate in the support and development of **Typus**,
including new features, by hiring our team to work on your project. We offer
customization services for modules and extensions for a fee.
